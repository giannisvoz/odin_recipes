# odin_recipes
My first HTML project!

Purpose of this simple project is to practice the very basics of HTML.

"The (Real) Odin Recipes" is my first project for "The Odin Project" course curriculum, and consists of four webpages containing some headings, paragraphs, images, links, and lists, as well some basic css styles.
