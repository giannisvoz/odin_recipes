  <h4>Pizza with anchovies</h4>
  <p>Cured anchovies on pizza is an old secret when it comes to boosting flavor. But if you are an anchovies lover like me simply adding a couple to the pizza toppings or working them into the sauce is not enough.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>16-20 oz pizza dough</li>
    <li>8 oz anchovy fillets in olive oil</li>
    <li>8 tbsp sour cream (or creme fraiche), adjust to taste</li>
    <li>1 small onion, sliced very thin</li>
    <li>4 small lemons, sliced ultra thin</li>
    <li>black pepper, freshly ground, as needed</li>
    <li>1 tbsp Italian flat leaf parsley, finely chopped for garnish</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat the oven to 425 F. Bring the dough to room temperature if it was refrigerated. Prepare pizza pans.</li>
    <li>Divide the dough in 4 equal parts, roll out thin to make about 10 inch individual pizzas.</li>
    <li>Spread 2 tbsp of sour cream onto each crust. Scatter thinly sliced onions, arrange the thinly sliced lemon circles on top and finally scatter the anchovy fillets. Season with black pepper.</li>
    <li>Bake for about 10 minutes or until the edges of the thin crust are crisp and nicely browned and the lemon slices just begin to caramelize. Garnish with parsley.</li>
  </ol>
